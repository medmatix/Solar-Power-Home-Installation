# Solar-Power-Home-Installation
Planning and Inplementation of my own Home Solar Power Installation.

## Overview
As rural electric power is becoming less reliable, more expensive and representing a growing carbon footprint it becomes urgent to consider solar and other adjunctive installtions for homes. In areas of the southern US, fossil fuel fired generation is the rule and nuclear though much preferred to fossil is much more expensive, has an extended lag time to come on line. Nuclear also suffers an image problem unwarranted in my view and based on paranoid and misinformed data.

As private solar installations come on line, off-grid promises are attractive but the promise of the new cottage industry of excess power capacity promises to build a sustainable energy economy. This is the perspective I have developed for myself and one which drives my design and implementation of my own home power plant.

As well the ease of acquiring the know how and even recognized qualifications through online certification course and their affordabilty should attract DIY Solar projects. The acquistion costs of turnkey third party home solar are large and daunting, to almost prohibitive. The DIY approach can make a significant dent in this and the flexibility of DIY allows one to choose to grow your installation in a manageable and sustainable fashion.
