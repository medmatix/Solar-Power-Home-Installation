# Solar-Power-Home-Installation
Planning and Implementation of my own Home Solar Power Installation.

## Overview
As rural electric power is becoming less reliable, more expensive and presents a growing carbon footprint it becomes urgent to consider solar and other adjunctive installations for homes. In areas of the southern US, fossil fuel fired generation is the rule and nuclear, though much preferred - I feel to fossil alternatives, is much more expensive and has an extended lag time to bring on line. Nuclear also suffers an image problem unwarranted in my view and based on paranoid and misinformed data.

As private solar installations come on line, off-grid promises are attractive but the promise of the new cottage industry of excess power capacity promises to build a sustainable energy economy. This is the perspective I have developed for myself and one which drives my design and implementation of my own home power plant.

As well, the ease of acquiring the know-how, and obtaining recognized qualifications through online certification courses, along with their affordabilty should attract DIY Solar projects. The acquisition costs of turnkey third party home solar are large and daunting, and almost prohibitive. The DIY approach can make a significant dent in this cost and the flexibility of DIY allows one to choose to grow your installation in a manageable and sustainable fashion.
